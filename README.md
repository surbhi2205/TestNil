FLDP Notes:

One on ones Template:

Sample Questions to ask:

“What really motivates you to perform at your best?”
“What do you wish you could spend more (or less) time doing?”
“What impact do you think you have had? What additional impact would you like to have?”
“What are your learnings, and how are you growing here?”
“How can we help you do more of that?”
“How can I help you be more successful?”
"How am I doing? Is there something I can do better?"
"How do you think that went?"
What do you enjoy the most about your job?
How do you think you did on that project?

Prep:
+Dive deep on the data to check employee’s performance(need to check by diving deep on metrics), project updates and developmental progress(can be done using I am High Performing quip.)



<Name of the engineer>
Strength:
Growth Ideas:(Projects or opportunities to grow that align with their super powers):  
Goal:(for their development, aligned with their growth ideas and/or focus areas):
Career Aspirations(Documented in Ingenii):




Boundaries:
Personality, Work style, preferences,
Personality: <Globesmart> 
Conflict Style: <Accomodating, Competing, Avoiding, Compromising, Collaborating>

Role:
Clear Goal(to meet performance bar for their role):




Business Cycle<Year>
Forte Conversations for this business cycle:
Talk about strengths, talk about places and opportunities where you can use that strength even more.(Make them feel valued)
What would you want to do differently? What do you want to keep doing? What is preventing you to achieve the goals that you would want to change?
What resonated with you? What made sense? What didn’t make sense?
“Keep doing what you are doing”. “Any surprises?” How do you interpret the feedback?
If it ends with pieces of ideas or action items at the end, it is successful.

Developing <>:
Identify development focus areas, employees start taking action.
Where are they in their development cycle? Coach accordingly.




One on Ones:
<date>
Performance Check/Conversations:<should-be-ready before one on ones>
Dive deep on the data to see how is the employee performing and give timely feedback based on the result.

Career Conversations:(documented in Ingenii).
Check the questions asked in the below link to ask from the employee while coaching them in career conversations.
https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/82245

Hold regular check-ins to see how they are performing against their goals(or action items decided).

Developmental Conversations:
Check the questions asked in the below link to ask from the employee while coaching them in developmental conversations.
https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/82245

More clarity on Career and Developmental Conversations: https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/64509?end=0h1m16s

Manager’s Feedback:<should-be-ready before one on ones>
Fact-based observation followed by description of the impact(impact should be tied to how they are getting impacted and not customers, so they would be more likely to listen to them) and an open-ended question.
For example,  “I’ve noticed that you’ve been late to half of the stand ups this month, resulting in your missing important updates. What’s going on?”

Connection’s question: <should-be-ready-before one on one>(if any sensitive question or direct feedback for manager>


Engineer’s Feedback:(on a process, decision, person)


Challenges to achieve their goal:

Action Items for the manager to take before the next one on one:
+Tell them why their feedback couldn’t be implemented.
+Tell them why their goal is important.
+Give them feedback.


Transcripts:
+Ice-Breaker:
What is the biggest thing on your mind today?
What are your priorities for this meeting?


Coaching Tips:<starts from a feedback or employee’s comment or may be an employee gets stuck>
GROW Model
Ask open ended questions to eventually help them define the below:
Goal:
Reality of the current situation:<metrics, behaviours, or patterns from themselves or others>
Options:<explore viable options>
Questions: 
What could you try doing differently in order to move past the current reality?
Note: Ask future-oriented questions about actions and behaviours that the employee hasn't tried yet.
Way Forward: Identify actions that the employee might be willing to own and take.

Example: So it is about.., I am also hearing....I don't have a lot of time, but what would be most valuable for you to walk away from this conversation..
Lets 'spend some time to identify the current state and then we could brain storm some way, tell me little bit of what is happening currently, ask follow up questions as well,
Sounds like, tehre is something about acknowledged that makes you feel appreciated,

Tell me how you are engaging when you interact?

Tell me how your voice quality is?

How do you know that you are heard?

We can't necessaily decide how they wil respond, but we could explore how you could experiment your tsrengths and influence a different behaviour?
What are the things that you can experiment from your strengths? What are the things that you could practice to get better at?

If there is someone at the team that you see gets heard more, is there anything you could learn from them?
How would you do that?

I am hearing two things that you might want to practice: 

How can I support you?





+Coaching Sample Questions:
What do you think went well in that project? What would you do differently next time?
What could you change in your approach that would get you better results on this project?
What is your biggest learning takeaway from this project?
What do you find most engaging about your current role?
What aspects of your current role would you like to see more of in a future role?

Real-life challenge: 
https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/227208

Employees will respond differently to coaching. One person might jump to action quickly, skipping the reflection phase and risking repeating negative patterns. Another person might find it challenging to take action, even after a great conversation about goals and options. Observe how each employee responds to coaching and guide the conversation so they get the full benefit. If an employee routinely seems eager to skip a phase of the process, don’t hesitate to point it out (e.g. “I notice that you seem to want to rush through considering options”) and have a discussion about what might be causing that response.
Things to consider for Forte:
+How to write growth idea?
Focus on strength or superpower, tell them this is how you can leverage your super power to realise the full potential of your abilities. You are doing good, but you have a lot of headroom for growth that can be achieved from the superpower you already have. And here is what I would do if I were in your shoes to leverage that.(Talk about the action items)
Basically, growth idea should align with the super power.




Things to consider for one on ones:

Point 1:
Set clear SMART goals, empower them, highlight their strengths and build their confidence, let them take full ownership, offer them inputs on how, what and whys of what they are doing, Appreciate them, and coach them, if needed and give them feedback, remove barriers so they could increase productivity. 

Support them with providing resources or answering their questions, get back to it as well, and mean it.

Ask them open ended questions, so they could tell you more information, listen more so you could get to know about them and identify their pain points.

You want to identify different personalities, work styles, expectations, preferences, and career aspirations on your team.

Make a Goal, a plan with clearly defined actions and follow up on action items.

Direct Reports- Strength and Growth Areas(Forte) 
Note: Growth Areas(Aligned with career goal or performance expectations or general feedback).
 
 Their goal( Ingenii)
Growth Plan: Addressing the growth areas to achieve that goal. Talks about actions needed to address the growth area for that goal, follow up on those actions.

All of the above can only be successful if they feel respected. If they do not convey their boundaries, you need to understand that from 1 on 1s, putting them on a perceived globsmart profiles based on your interaction, listening more, asking open ended questions in 1 on 1s, asking questions to them directly.


Point2:
Making people within the team feel included:

Why: 
So they want to stay in the team, so job satisfaction increase, so they co-operate in meeting team goals and making the team grow, so they care about the team, people are not robots, they have needs, which needs to be met, so they could feel safe receiving and sharing feedback so we could act on early rather than it being escalated, so they can be vulnerable and not afraid to share their mistakes, because they think about the entire team, they are accepted for who they are, not made to feel ashamed or embarrassed for sharing things about themselves, there is genuine open-ness. 

What:
+Respected: Their boundaries are respected(every individual is different).
How to know about their boundaries?
+Meet with every team member in one on ones
+Listen to them more. If they don’t talk, ask open ended questions:
What is the biggest thing on your mind today?
What are your priorities for this meeting?
+Keep a note of their boundaries and needs and remember to respect them.(Treat them the way they would like to be treated.)
Q. How would they want to be appreciated?
Q. What is their communication style?

+Valued: 
Make them feel wanted, focus on their strengths, talk about their uniqueness and strengths, build their confidence.
Tell them that their feedback is important and that their unique perspective is welcome.
Encourage them to share if there are any barriers to their productivity, so you could remove them.

+Trusted:
Accept them for who they are, be vulnerable, and understand every human makes mistakes(have empathy). 
Assume good intentions and don’t ask them to prove their intentions.
Trust that they are doing everything in their capacity to meet their goals regardless of their personal circumstances, ask them for any barriers they are facing so you could remove them.
Listen to their feedback, if you can’t take action on their feedback, explain to them why, 
Trust them with important work. Team members should trust each other to do important work.
 
+Informed: 
+Give them clear goals and share constructive and timely feedback. Also be transparent with them. Explain the “why’s” of very thing you inform them.
+Provide them support resources (and share ideas they could implement at their level) with them to help them navigate their career if they expressed their desire to be in a career or get to a goal of their choice. Share with them their superpowers and growth areas and guide them in ways they could tap onto their strength to innovate on behalf of the customers.
+ If they ask any question, get back to them with answers, make them connect with someone in the org if you don’t have an answer.

+Connected: 
Meet with them on one on ones, catch up with team and meet with them regularly, reply to their messages.
Following up on the goals conveyed, so they feel that the manager cares about them.
Inform the whole team on projects or any initiatives that comes in.
Take up initiatives to do something that makes everyone in the team feel connected with each-other, encourage people to use their pronouns

How:
one on ones(meeting every team member individually), getting to know them individually(so they can convey their boundaries, needs, and expectations).
+Meet with every team member in one on ones
+Listen to them more. If they don’t talk, ask open ended questions:
What is the biggest thing on your mind today?
What are your priorities for this meeting?
+Keep a note of their boundaries and needs and remember to respect them.(Treat them the way they would like to be treated.)
+Use leadership principles to give them direction of where we want to go, and use LPs as a language to convey an information to the direct reportees.
+In a private setting, ask that employee about their preferences for making contributions, if you see someone not contributing in a meeting and being reserved.
+Avoiding getting into the trap of unconscious bias.
Common Types of Unconscious Bias:
Affinity: Folks that are like us, 
Anchoring: when we rely on one piece of information, particularly recent.
Conformation Bias: Look for ways to justify our beliefs, seek belief that would help confirm that.
Attribution Bias: Someone couldn’t do something because the other team was inexperienced, or because they are always this way, or she is always this way, so she should be this way this time too.

=========================================================

Narrative Writing:

Purpose: Put your bottom line on top

Example: 
The purpose of this document is to gain alignment with IT Services and AWS Security on proposed changes to the customer-facing language that is used to describe how Amazonians securely access the Amazon network. The goal of these language changes is to reduce customer confusion and IT Support tickets by simplifying and standardizing authentication content.


Three things required in Purpose:
What the writer wants to achieve - align on proposed changes
What customer problem they're trying to solve - reduce customer confusion
Who needs to perform an action - IT services and AWS security

Note: If there are multiple solutions proposed, it doesn’t make sense to list them in Purpose. However, if you have one problem and one solution, you can consider summarising them in Purpose.

Never include new information in the Executive Summary, Objective or Purpose which isn't mentioned in the main body. It is not a place to include new information and should only summarise what's covered in detail in the rest of the document.

A Purpose or Objective should include:
What is expected of the reader (approval, advice, alignment, etc)
A brief description of the problem and solutions if not too long

Background: Assume your reader knows very little

Background
All Amazonians who access the Amazon network via laptops use security keys. They rely on the authentication process to be able to do their jobs and access the information they need. Authentication is a multi-part process with different owners to register, use, and troubleshoot issues around authentication: the Midway team, IT services, AWS Security. We have collaborated effectively to build a robust authentication process. However, there is an opportunity to improve the way our customers interact with our services.

They want to know what is happening now? How are engineers getting effected by the current training guidelines? What is the impact of this on engineers or our customers?

How close is the reader to the customer? The customer in this case is all Amazonians. There's an assumption that most readers will understand the needs of employees' as they are employees themselves who use the products being described. Therefore, the customer is identified but not much extra information about the customer is provided here.
What background information do readers need to know to understand the problem and want to support your solutions? The writer has pointed out that the problem comes from having different owners. And that the different owners are actually doing a good job of building a robust process. There is a subtle compliment added into the background: "We have collaborated effectively..." and "robust". This is aimed at the readers who are from different teams. 
How familiar is the team and its charter to the reader? For this document, the readers were very close to the team and knew the charter, so there isn't much information added here.

Problem/Opportunity:
There’s room for improvement in how we educate customers on and talk about authentication. Standardizing and simplifying content is one way to improve the experience for all Amazonians, but especially new hires. Improving content will also reduce the number of TTs relating to Midway (currently 9% of all IT support tickets). There is a separate work stream to identify inefficiencies in the authentication process that will be presented in detail in the near future.
New hires have to learn about USB security keys that are referred to as tokens in their Midway dashboard, setting a Midway PIN, registering or revoking or deregistering a USB security key or token, and signing in with Midway to access the Amazon VPN and their Midway dashboard. The connection between USB security keys, Amazon VPN, and Midway isn’t intuitive. Our team noticed that this contributes to a steep Day 1 learning curve and decided to survey our customers for feedback.
In January 2020, interviews with 106 new hires at a Seattle new hire fair revealed that 34% of them reported that USB security key-related issues were a blocker to their onboarding process. Of these, 27% were confused by how their security keys work and when to use them. 25% were confused by the instructions and the different terms that are used for describing the same thing, and 16% didn’t realize on Day 1 that they needed 2 separate passwords.
Four of the top five lowest-rated articles on it.amazon.com are related to Midway . In the trailing 4 weeks, 9% of contacts to IT Support were driven by Midway-related issues. On the highest day, Midway-related issues accounted for 12% of total contacts, making it one of the top ten contacts drivers. See Appendix A.
New hires account for the majority of Midway-related contacts. Security key registration issues and PIN issues are the most common reasons for contacts from new hires, with the majority of these contacts happening on Mondays - Day 1 for these new hires. See Appendix B.


In your narrative, this section will tell your reader why they should care. If your reader doesn't believe there is a problem, you're going to struggle to sell your recommendations. You will need data to quantify the problem wherever possible.

Steps:
Brief summary of who the customer is, what is the problem, its cause and its impact
Then add examples of the problem and may be three sets of data supporting the impact of the problem.

Recommendations:
The following high-level content recommendations streamline the language throughout the authentication experience. By simplifying the language we use, we make the security key process more intuitive and reduce the need for customer contacts to IT support. Customers use a security key password with their security key, and visit their security key dashboard to make necessary changes. All of the terms match, reducing cognitive friction points. We recommend standardizing and applying this to sign-in pages, within the Midway dashboard, in emails, in FAQs, and in it.amazon.com and technical documentation.
Lead with Security key, but do not remove Midway
The term “security key” is the primary term we use when referring to the authentication process. We recommend reserving the term Midway for technical documentation that details how the process works, or in scenarios where it’s required to differentiate between the requirements for using different authentication services (e.g. Federate vs. Midway). Examples of the practical application of this recommendation include:
For TT and IT Support categorization, issues relating to Midway can be relabeled as either security key issues or security key login issues.
To register your security key, visit the “Security key dashboard.” To explain why Midway is part of the URL on the security key sign in page, that page would include one sentence explaining that Midway is the name of the service that provides secure access to the Amazon VPN.
By minimizing the term Midway in customer-facing content, we reduce the number of Amazon-specific terms relating to the process of signing in to the Amazon VPN.
Midway team feedback: We disagree with the suggestion of using Midway only in technical documentation. We want to call thing by their proper name, just like we talk about Chrome and Firefox and Edge (and not say browser). A Midway key is something used by the Midway system. Users register their Midway key at midway.amazon.com and sign in at midway-auth.amazon.com. When they contact IT support, it is because they cannot sign into Midway. The meaning is precise.

Notice how this section is structured:
Introduction to the section, summarising the changes being made and where they will be made.
Sub-sections with their own headers for each individual change including:
Description of recommendation
Reasons why that recommendation is proposed
Feedback from the other team even though it contradicts
In the subsection, notice how this example includes:
What will be implemented (input) - use "security key" for customer-facing content and "Midway" for technical documentation.
What you predict will happen if it is implemented (output) - reduce the number of Amazon-specific terms.
What long-term change you predict will happen (outcome) - make the security key process more intuitive and reduce the need for customer contacts to IT support (from first paragraph in main section).
The pros and cons of the recommendation - pros are the output and outcome, cons are listed by Midway team feedback (eg. less precise, not calling by proper name).

Next Steps:
What the next steps would be, how your recommendations would be implemented, so the audience can imagine a brighter future.
Examples of next steps:
finding a solution that works, working with other teams to find other solutions, or doing more research. 

But if you have an idea of which recommendation might pass approval, you can start listing a timeline of events which will happen next. The next steps are often listed as a timeline where there are multiple deadlines and dates. If this doesn't apply to your doc, use paragraphs and sentences instead.

To include:

Actions which need to be taken and by whom (eg. further reviews, approvals, implementation, etc)
Any conflicting dates or events which impact implementation
Any dates you have or can predict for implementation (Note: don't be too ambitious here! Choose reasonable timelines.)
Any requests for help in removing blockers or speeding up implementation

Conclusion:

Your Conclusion is going to be very similar to your Executive Summary:
What is expected of the reader now they've read the doc (approval, advice, alignment, etc)
A summary of the problem
A summary of the recommendation(s)
A summary of the next steps

Conclusion
In summary, the language we are using to describe authentication is causing confusion for our internal customers and, therefore, increased avoidable contacts to IT services. We seek approval for five language changes on authentication:
1. Use “Security key” for customer-facing documentation and “Midway” for internal documentation.
2. Use “Security key password” instead of “Midway PIN”.
3. Use “Security keys” as a single term for customer-facing documentation and “Midway token”, “USB security token”, “USB security key”, “Zukey”, and “Yubikey” for technical documentation.
4. Use “Security key dashboard” instead of “Midway dashboard”.
5. Use “sign in with your security key password and security key” instead of “authenticate” or “authentication”.
Once alignment is reached on language changes to be made, we will start the process of communicating and amending changes all relevant documents.

Immersion Week: Narrative Writing: Important things to note

Important Points:
Six Pager(usually for one way decisions)
Prepare for document(collect data)
Get feedback early(start writing and get feedback)
Schedule document review meeting(be prepared for answering the questions from senior leadership)
Lead the document review meeting(put a stop on distractors, even though they may be your seniors, they might get into problem solving, remind them that we are just heading for the concept here)
Follow up on the feedback provided on the document.

Tips and Tricks:
Spelling, grammar, punctuation, try reading out loud to see if it makes sense.
Formatting(10-11 pt ‘Amazon Ember’ recommended)
Acronyms(Use full forms)
Dates→ 5 Jan 2023(used everywhere though out the globe)
Other→ single line, left aligned, no funny words or phrases
Specific(data)
Cover off why

Critical things to note:
Footer: Every page should have footer of “Amazon Confidential” at the bottom.
Page number and Line no(so you could refer to the page number and line number while explaining something.)
Doc must not contain reference to authors(The idea lives with pillar, and they are owning and executing it, so if any questions, reach out to the team within the pillar owning that idea.)

MicroLevel:
Use Active Voice(Zombie Tip) If you can add by zombies at the end, it is wrong. Example of Active voice: Steve axed wood. Passive voice(Wood was axed by Steve) should not be used.
Remove vague language and weasel words(weasel words are probably, faster, longer, some, etc)
Specific
Remove adverbs and adjectives
Positive and inclusive language

Tools: Already bookmarked under Capstone Project

1. Doc Bar Raiser Reviewer Tool
2. PRFAQ writing tool

Promo Doc:
Review Role Guidelines first, before writing the doc.

=============================================

Meeting Tips

Meetings are for building relationships:(Know the other person well, their background, experiences, what needs to be done to respect their boundaries, every person is different).

* Agree to common values and code of conduct
* Create a shared goal for the connection
* Establish a key ‘rules’ for how meeting would be run.
* Establish a meeting cadence(how frequently the meeting would happen) before leaving.


Important: 

1. Why is this meeting important? (Be ready with this)
2. What discussed in this meeting? (Be ready with this, but be flexible if that “what“ changes after hearing the perspective of the other person and also be transparent if you don’t agree with the “what”)
3. How are we going to achieve what we discuss in the meeting?(Have clear Action items as to “how“ the ”what“ needs to be achieved.
4. Establish when you are going to meet next.


Actual scheduling a meeting:

1. Check the calendar of the person you want to invite to the meeting: https://it.amazon.com/help/articles/check-calendar-availability-in-outlook#tab-body-825
2. Add an auto-call feature so chime auto-calls them: https://it.amazon.com/help/articles/auto-call-attendees-in-amazon-chime
3. Configure Recurrence in Outlook/or any meeting invitation tool.
4. Take down notes of the meeting and share it with the other person.


Tips:

1. Add your signature in Outlook
2. Create your own chime meeting room like: https://chime.aws/Changwonkrps


Techniques of Effective Meeting:


1. Five Qualities of an Effective Meeting:
    

+Do we need this meeting?
Have I thought about this situation? No (Then I need to reschedule the meeting and do some strategic thinking first)
Yes, then do I need some outside input? Yes, then doe smoving forward require a real-time conversation?Yes, then does this necessitate a face to face conversation?Yes, then scheule and prepare for the meeting 

+Define agenda and clear purpose
Clear Objectives of the meeting
We can do the below inside the body of the invite:
Purpose: What is the purpose of the meeting?
Process: How are we going to accomplish this? 
PayOff: What is the result of the meeting?

+Choose attendees very carefully.
Is this person able to make a decision or add value to the agenda topic? Yes, then invite.(I may invite as I don’t want to make them feel bad.)
+Share information in advance
+Summarise the meeting at the end and assign tasks

+Choose the right channel for the meeting


1. Discover different personalities and how to best manage them: First, know about their personalities. If they are people in your team, you know them, but if it is a new team, just say:We have got a lot of new people in the room. Why don’t we have a quick introduction from us all. Your Name, How long have you been here at AWS, if you could be an animal what animal you could be(to get to know about their personalities.) There would be some people you got nothing, they are going to be the silent Sam’s of the room, would only listen.


Personalities:
+Sally Sidebar: Having sidebar convo while the meeting is on
Tips:
Hey I didn’t hear Phil’spoint.
Hey Sally, do you have a specific contribution to the topic?
Appoint Sally a role.


+Rambling Ronnie:
Very conceptual, hard time articulating his idea.
Tips:
In the interest of time,
Let’s move forward,
Summarise the points so Sally who is taking the notes could jot it down.
Can you just boil it down to one phrase?


+Dominant Dan:
Very smart and intelligent, Likes to take over convos, no one can get a word in
Tips:
Compliment→ Document→ Pivot
That is a great idea, why don’t we write that idea down, and Ronnie can you tell me what do you think of that idea?



1. Learn Simple structures when responding(when asked a cold call question)

Problem→ Solution → Benefit
What? → So What? → Now What?



Why to have a face to face meeting:
+Solving complex business problem
+Doing deep thinking
+To make decisons


4. Meeting Methods:
+Stop, Start, Continue


1. 3 Minute Meeting Planner


===================

Manager Targets:


Tenets:

+People: Valued, Trusted, Informed and Connected(both team members and the leadership should feel inclusive)
+Mechanisms:  Helps in developing a system through which something is done(eg: HSR) Every mechanism can have workflows for every aspect. Every mechanism need detailed understanding of it.(Narrative document is the best way to understand a mechanism.)
+Tools and Hard Skills: Tools that enable putting in through and deciding the mechanism. Tools also need to be learnt by working on tool skills. Tools, like Excel, tableu, powerpoint, quip, Ingenii, Ivy, reporting, diving deep on the data.
+Practices:The way everyone navigates this. For example, one on ones, Forte Conversations, team meetings, connection reviews, office hours, weekly business review, monthly business review, annual reviews, launch plan, narrative and promo doc writing, career growth plans, career development goal.
+Resources: Following practices and doing manager’s function is supported by relevant resources.
+Soft skills: Communication Mechanisms, Sharing feedback, understanding of leadership principles, Amazon Writing
+Leadership Principle: Understanding of what is the meaning of leadership principle that defines our culture as an entire company.
+Role: 
People Management (Hiring, Onboarding, Managing and developing)
Operations Management(Diving deep on the data, and preparing WBR, MBR and QBR)

Basically use the soft-skills and hard-skills in all the practices that we follow to perform our roles.




Ground work to meet targets smoothly:
People: Making people feel included, Onboarding, Hiring, sharing their individual goals, developing and managing, inclusion tips materials
Process: Know about the processes, process improvements( mechanisms to be created or initiatives needed).
Tools: Understanding tools like connection, tableau, Ingenii, Writing(Promodoc and Narrative)
Understanding the goals well, ask questions from the senior leadership, if required.
Communication:
Understanding LP so LP can be integrated in the way we speak.
Understanding team goals so it can be conveyed to the team.


Targets:
Individual Goals:
Share in one on ones, slack, quip shared between individual and manager.
Team Goals:
Clearly Share in team meetings, stand ups, etc.

Challenges:

Individual Challenges:
Identify individual challenges
Addressed via one on ones
Team Challenges:
Share in team meeting


Team Challenges:
+Identify team challenges(Connections: Meeting Tips One on ones Template) or some identified challenges yourself, if someone says something.
+Propose a solution and identify the owner responsible to get to the solution and give them everything in your capacity to address the solution and keep everyone in the loop.

Solution: Mechanism, initiative, process change, and then communicated well


What do the managers do?
+Shout outs to engineers
+Sharing about a new workflow through a for example, HSR mechanism, or an entire mechanism, making engineers understand what is in it for them, communicating about things that are changing.(through email, stand up, office hours,etc) if people leaving, process changing.
+Communicate to them about an opportunity.
What if everyone is asking questions in the team about that change?
+Make a quip for everyone to ask HSR questions(where everyone can add questions).
+Share feedback with relevant teams and work with them to address those concerns
+Convey what was done about it to your team.(if there is a lot to convey conduct office hours and share the summary at the end of office hour)
+If something can benefit the team, share it along to the them.
+Organise events, leave audit, promote Diversity and Inclusion, organise meetings, catch ups, etc

Who do they deal with?
+Work Force Management(Leaves, etc) Leave management
+What is done about engineer’s feedback.
+Teams who have built mechanisms relevant to your team.

FLDP Mentor-Mentee Sessions

Things to discuss:
+Looking at the strengths and growth areas of the mentee based on manager readiness document and identifying one career development goal.(besides Capstone Project)
Note: The goal needs to be accomplished by the end of the program. Should align with the growth areas outlined in the manager readiness document. Mentee would track the progress of that goal in Ingenii.
+To identify activities and projects that will help the mentee grow/achieve the goal decided.
+Discuss insights/takeaways from training materials from previous weeks’ eLearnings and instructor-led courses.
+Following up on the actions taken towards achieving the career development goal decided and receive feedback.
+Working towards the goal of getting ideas for Capstone Project and establishing action items to take to finish it by the end of the program.

Expectations from the mentor:
+Introducing to key individuals
+Help to find job as a manager
+Guide mentee on skills needed for a manager and give ideas on how any growth areas be covered.

Note: 
Mentor would use Manager Readiness document to base the above discussions.
Mentee would take actions and track it in Ingenii, ask questions and drive the above discussions.

19th July 2023:

Role of Operations Manager: 
People Management
Operations Management

Recommendations:
We have weekly operations review, I can talk with my manager and learn about what is important for operations and what metrics we track to improve our operations. 
Every team is different and every team tracks different metrics based on its area of improvement.
Weekly business review happens where Simon leads the team and Satheesh does business review meeting.

Manager Readiness Criteria document to be shared by manager to mentor so mentor gets an idea about mentee’s possible growth areas.

02nd Aug 2023:
Going through Manager Readiness Document and talking about what managers need to do.

 We always think of mechanism or process to prevent similar issues in the future.
We need to make people work in a particular direction, engage people, make the direction clear.
We work together, provide reasons as to why we believe that is the thing we create, and tell engineers why the decison was made.
Set expectations and Provide feedback, not everyone is perfect, Create goals, set expectations and provide feedback
Why: If there is gap and if we don’t set right expectations and provide continuous feedback based on expectations, engineers would get frustrated by the outcome at the end(because they didn’t expect that, they might think they are doing great and they may not be if we didn’t set expectations clearly.)
Respect Diverse view, everything has pros and cons, that way they would be encouraged to speak, otherwise they just shut their mouth and they don’t share much, we need to hear feedback and opinion from others.
Enabling others to focus on team goals and priority., think about the entire team, thinking of the entire team can impact some people, sometimes that same thing is good for some people and bad for some others. Think of team goals and priorities, and sometimes managers need to make hard decisions.

For example, in OLR: Assess engineer’s performance, need to make hard decisions, bad performers for a long time, people managers make decisions for entire team, so people be motivated to work hard.

Need to make decisions from team’s perspective.

You need to provide data for a decision.
If you make a decision, measure its impact.
How to measure the impact of the decison?
Think Pros and Cons of a decision. What will happen if we make a change? What will happen if we let things be? Do we have any alternatives?
 
If it is a two way door-decisions, practise bias for action and don’t waste time diving deep, 

Think Pros and Cons, and alternatives provide them guideline and plan to make more people attend. Think about other stakeholders.

Action Items:
Think about "Use mechanisms to drive outcome for the customer"

Home-Work:
Use mechanisms to drive outcome for the customer.
Cross-Account Support problem:

Problem/Impact:
Security is at risk if information about resources in one account is sent to customers of another account. 

Solution:
+Training engineers to verify the account no associated with the case against the account no associated with the resource.
+Encouraging engineers to share instances where they handled cross account support scenarios correctly and call them out in standup/meeting.
+Add a CC tooling mechanism where engineers can’t reply to a case if the resources shared in the case by the customer belong to a different account.

How:
+Regular KNET Mandatory Security Tip trainings

16th Aug:
 Discussion on the previous action item:
Thought Areas while deciding the mechanism:
Identify why the problem happened- process or engineer mistakes
Identify big picture and not one example
Not solely relying on engineer, but making a process instead, because we have New Hires, teams keep changing, etc
While deciding the mechanism, consider the cost, make a cost benefit 
Focus is to prevent that kind of an issue again.
Building up a process or tool is the best.

This aligns with our LPs Invent and Simplify.

Things to think about for Capstone Project:

Impact of this problem, expectations, relevant teams, team’s efficiency and operations

What will happen if the situation keeps going the way it is?

Is the problem big enough for us to focus on?

Action Items:
Ask Dax if it is okay for the mentor to share manager readiness document?
Think about the problem statement for Capstone Project.
Think about “Navigate through changes to ensure peer buy-in and engagement”

Home Work:
Navigate through changes to ensure peer buy-in and engagement:

It means that me, as a manager is suggesting a change in direction because there is some problem following through the current direction, but would need to make sure all other involved teams are on board with me on that.

I would first discuss the impact of the problem, not just on my team but on their team and work as well. I will explain to them what will happen if we don’t do anything and leave the way things are, so they come on board with me on why it is important to do something about the problem.
Then I would explain how my suggestion would help address the pitfalls of the current way of doing things. I would use data and metrics to support my suggestion, so people come on board.
Would try to put my suggestion as easy to follow action items as much as I can, so the teams are likely to jump into it sooner, if they think it may not require much effort to start seeing the results.
I would listen to different perspectives from different teams and make changes or modifications in my suggestions, if required. They would also feel they are heard and likely be heard in the future when the suggestion is actually carried out practically.

Leadership Principle: Dive Deep would lead to Earning Trust. 


30th Aug:
Discussion on the previous action item:
Great answers, covered everything on “Discuss Navigate through changes to ensure peer buy-in and engagement”
Mentee won’t be able to attend session on 13th Sep and that would be rescheduled.

Dive Deep is important, but sometimes bias for action is needed for a two-way door decision.
Bias for Action is two-way door situation, different situation to make a decision, even though you don’t have enough data, but if it is pressing, you can make a decision.

Mentor shared Manager Readiness document with the mentee.
Mentor shared two example initiative documents with the mentee.

Action Items:
Think about “Set expectations and provide ongoing feedback”
Go through example initiative documents and start writing for your Capstone Project on "Building a mechanism to ensure we deliver quality training to all our engineers."
Go through the Coaching PPT shared by Dax to ask questions to the mentor.

20th Sep:
Reviewed FLDP course, Coaching:

Coaching is about finding gaps between actual situation and our expectation and discussing about how to meet the gap.
Coaching is mechanism or strategic way to meet the gap.
They need help to handle critical situation, so coaching instills trust.
We manage risk, detecting risk in early stage, and mitigating the risk by coaching.
Reviewing performance of each engineer on weekly basis, each engineer show consistent performance, sometimes there is drop or spike, we need to find out the reason, use one on one to find out if there is any concern or issue.

27th Sep:
Discussed Capstone Project:

Achieve a specific level of quality, not the same level of quality training.
How do we measure the quality of the training and then Improve the quality of training
We don’t have an effective way of measuring the quality of the training, no mechanism to reflect the feedback received in our training mechanism, so need to close the loop
PM and manager could go through the feedback together and think about improvement areas.
Deciding the action items
Deciding who can work on the action items
For technical trainings, we can prepare training questions(before and after training) so we measure the knowledge absorbed.
The feedback questions are very old, so it doesn’t reflect the current situation well.
Need to update questions, ask related questions to specific training.

11th Oct:

Find the solutions for different reasons
There could be that the content is not enough, talk to training PM and find possible reasons, and solution for each reason.
Technical knowledge or the training skills

Based on the training feedback, the training team would reach out to the manager only if the below two criteria is not met:

The trainer(s) was knowledgeable about the training topics.
The trainer(s) was skilled at presenting the material
If the feedback is low because of a different criteria(not the above two), the training PM would be responsible to see how they can improve other things. They can reach out to the operations manager for any help needed, but eventually they are responsible.

4. Managing

Hiring:
+Maintain a high hiring bar. Never sacrifice quality of hire to meet a short term business need. Rather, ensure that all hires raise the bar and have the potential for long term impact at Amazon. 
+Ensure that you consider diversity in your hiring process. Part of being right a lot is seeking diverse perspectives and creating diverse teams.
+Set up loops for your candidate that provide a good candidate experience. Review information about the interview process for managers in the Interviewing Process Guide for Managers
+Learn about the overall hiring process and find resources on the https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/PXT_AMI_BCD_DS_PVS/Manager_Resources/Hiring

Onboarding:

 Create an Embark
Opens in a new tab
Link to embark.corp.amazon.com
 launch plan for your new hire. 
Assign your new employee an onboarding buddy. 
Identify key Amazonians for the new hire to meet. 
Ensure that the new hire has a clear understanding of the organization and how their role contributes to it. 
Set clear goals with your new hire. 
Ensure that you're providing reasonable accommodations
Opens in a new tab
Link to inside.hr.amazon.dev
 to meet specific needs of your employees. 
If your employee will be hired or onboarded remotely, make extra time to meet with them and set up team meetings to welcome them.

Developing:

 Role model the Leadership Principle: Hire and Develop the Best. 
Use the Amazon tools and resources to help your employees grow and develop new skills. 
Have effective development discussions with your direct reports to help them succeed (e.g., performance and career conversations).
Bring an awareness of diversity and inclusion to developing your employees. Work to become aware of, and mitigate biases that could negatively affect how you develop your employees.

Managing:

Set clear goals and expectations with your direct reports. 
Provide regular feedback, positive and constructive, to make sure your employees always know where they stand. 
Set a regular cadence to talk to each of your directs about their overall performance (e.g., quarterly career conversations, mid-year check-ins, and annual reviews). 
Explore Ivy
Opens in a new tab
Link to ivy-help-center.talent.a2z.com
, the one-stop-shop for Amazon Talent Management practices where you can find information for managing performance. 
Take time to learn about the different cultures and skill sets on your team. 
Create an inclusive team culture where people are comfortable sharing ideas, feel safe giving and receiving feedback, and remote employees feel included.


Note:
Within the Manager lifecycle, often managers confuse the developing phase with managing phase. Both phases include employees’ performance and career growth. Managers in the developing phase focus on having open and candid conversations regarding employees’ growing opportunities. Managers in the managing phase, however, focus more on providing feedback and determining appropriate next steps for the employee based on their performance. 

Managing: Set Clear expectations with the direct reportees→ Provide regular feedback with clear action items(SBI model) → Start coaching from there so the employee get to where you want them to go post feedback.

Handy things to do as a manager:
+1:1s:
Asking open ended question:(1 on 1s are about the employees)
What is the biggest thing on your mind today?
What are your priorities for this meeting?

You are looking for them to answer these questions: Different personalities(chart out a personality from globesmart), work styles, expectations, preferences, and career aspirations on your team

+Block out weekly time to review Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly Business Reviews.

Note: Managers learn the technique of coaching, developing, providing feedback and deliver it through 1 on 1s and other channels.

Learning Outcome:
Differentiate between mental models of IC vs. Manager including identifying behaviours that indicated a successful mental model shift.
Refer to that IC vs Manager Chart and do all the trainings in the Manager Lifecycle Section to develop, coach, feedback.
See if you are doing everything and how are you planning to achieve that?

Learning OutCome:
Describe common first-time manager challenges and pitfalls including common mitigation strategies:


Strategy of managing a former peer:

+Acknowledge the changing dynamic:
Acknowledge in your head that the dynamics is now manager-to-direct-report dynamic
+Manage awkwardness
I am feeling a little awkward about this. How are you feeling?
+Recognise potential areas of discomfort:
Encourage them to share any concern they may have about your new role. Listen, thank them for sharing and follow up on the feedback they provided. This would Earn Trust as a manager.
+Set expectations clearly and early:
Set expectations on how you want to communicate, and how you will deal with issues when they arise.
+Exercise Empathy: Tell them you know the issues faced by them, and remove roadblocks to improve productivity.
+Acknowledge Experience: Respect the knowledge and expertise of your former peers. Express your desire for collaborative success, and invite their input whenever possible. In team meetings and in project assignments, look to your entire team to supplement your skills. 

Strategy of managing a new formed team:

+Focus on People: Understand their career aspirations, working styles, preferences, etc
+Learn to Let go: Important to provide them autonomy to do the work.
+Focus on What’s Relevant: 
+Provide Support: Set Outcome Expectations and provide feedback. Coach them on overarching issues, but trust them with ownership on day to day things.

Thus, Clearly explain the results you expect and encourage employees’ Ownership while offering input that helps employees grow and learn. 


Common Pitfalls:


There are several other pitfalls you're likely to encounter as a first-time manager, including: 
 Thinking you must show authority and leadership strength to be accepted and gain respect 
Underestimating the importance of building relationships and prioritising time to get to know the different personalities, work styles, expectations, preferences, and career aspirations on your team.
Undervaluing the importance of getting your team’s perspectives on the projects they’re working on.
Underestimating how important it is for people to feel valued and acknowledged for their efforts.
Not realizing how much influence your position has now that you are a manager

Support your team by:

Identify and then remove barriers to delivering results. 
Support your team to reach goals you set together. 
Delegate work, then create mechanisms for audit and inspection. 
Empower your team to own the work, then get out of their way. 
Provide timely feedback and coaching. 
Intervene, coach, and provide support if needed.

Earn Trust within the team:

Conduct regular 1:1s with all members of your team. 
Understand each employees' skills and work with them to select the projects they take on. 
Identify and make the time to meet with partner teams, peers, and other stakeholders. 
Spend time informally connecting with the team; not everything has to be an official meeting. 
Provide effective feedback to help your team develop the right capabilities.
Seek to understand cultural differences, employees’ communication preferences, and how each employee might demonstrate Leadership Principles differently. 
Create a safe environment where everyone can do their best work.


Recognise that what got you here won’t get you there:

Build listening skills and demonstrate empathy for your employees’ needs. 
Ensure that you don’t react negatively and emotionally to employee feedback; doing so could hinder earning their trust. 
Seek diverse perspectives when solving problems and making decisions. 
Accept responsibility for the actions of your team. 
Acknowledge and accept that your team will do tasks differently than you would.



Examples of Using the Leadership Principles as a Manager

Customer Obsession::(cultivating an environment where customer is an ongoing focus)

Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer’s trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers. 
As an individual contributor you likely: 
 Pursued balanced customer feedback, and not just solicited for compliments 
Asked, “Is what I’m working on helping my customer?” 
Avoided assuming that you know more about your customers than they do 
Stopped activities as soon as you realized they no longer elevated the customer experience 
Now as a manager, you will also: 
 Ensure that you and your team maintain ongoing focus on your customer 
Use customer-obsessed approaches and tools to lead your team and stay connected to the customer 
Understand that what you do will directly or indirectly impact the customer experience (if it doesn’t, then it’s probably not necessary)

Ownership:(Creating an environment where everyone is comfortable speaking up and challenging decisions respectfully)

As an individual contributor you likely: 
 Considered future outcomes that were scalable, and added long-term value 
Spoke up in meeting to question or challenge respectfully 
Understood your role and relationship with other roles 
Understood the impact of your work on others 
Partnered with peers across the network 
Now as a manager, you will also: 
 Empower the members of your team to think long-term, take Ownership, and make decisions 
Address problems and challenges head-on, driving change instead of passing defects down the line 
Foster an environment of autonomy where an employee can prioritize and make decisions 
Create an environment where your team is comfortable speaking up and challenging decisions respectfully 
Think about the impact of your decisions on other teams, sites, and the customer over time 
Coach your team to understand the big picture, how their role supports the overall objectives of Amazon, and how it ties to others

Dive Deep:(auditing your team’s progress, ask questions if required, provide feedback if needed, holding employees accountable).

As an individual contributor you likely: 
 Refrained from passing along unwanted tasks, demonstrating hustle and a "do what it takes" attitude to get things done 
Had a firm grasp of the details of your work and had a deep expertise in that work 
Frequently “audited” your work by checking accuracy, facts, and assumptions 
Now as a manager, you will also: 
 Stay closely connected to the details of the business and projects, knowing when to get involved without micromanaging 
Stay connected with people at all levels, not just with your direct reports, by scheduling casual calls and engaging different parts of the organization 
Frequently “audit” by drilling down into your team projects, questioning and providing feedback to employees, quickly assessing progress and risk, and holding employees accountable for results 
Prioritize and help your team prioritize 
When analyzing data, consider both numbers and customer anecdotes.

Have Backbone;Disagree and Commit(Help team understand the rationale behind the decisions, and get on board with it even though not agreed)

As an individual contributor you likely: 
 Questioned rigorously, challenged assumptions, and escalated issues up and across when you were not satisfied, even if unpopular 
Stood up for what you believe is in the best interest of the company and your customers 
Got on board with decisions that were made, even though you may not have originally agreed 
Now as a manager, you will also: 
 When disagreeing, use data and anecdotes to tell the story and explain the why 
Re-frame disagreement through the lens of the customer, and articulate customer impact and the associated risks 
Share data with your team, listen to all of their voices, and keep an open mind; then drive commitment across the team 
Provide information about why a decision was made the way it was, rather than delivering it as a final decree 
Openly demonstrate your support and commitment to decisions, even though you may not have originally agreed; refrain from being transparent with these types of decisions in the best interests of your employees

Things to do:

Look for people whose super powers align with your development goal

Create your own Launch Plan→ Recognise areas of focus, and look for opportunities to do that, check Launch Plan 30-60-90 days.
Create goal→ Track it in Ingenii, identify people who can help you in your goal, refer to Partners document in Workdocs.

Understanding in my words: 
Week2: Transition to Management

It is all about employees achieving their goals. right?
Set clear SMART goals by explaining why, what and how of what they are doing and with actionable tasks to do.
You need them to be in the right mindset to work towards the goal right?
Empower them, build their confidence, let them take full ownership.
Then follow up on how they are doing in achieving their goals by diving deep on the data(check in with your biases, like halo or horn effect).
Give them feedback if necessary with clear action items(before feedback try asking open ended questions, chances are that you may be missing something or not aware of something), and then follow up again using data(dive deep)
Coaching:  Ask them how you could support them to increase productivity, ask open ended questions, remove barriers so they could increase productivity. 
Support them with providing resources or answering their questions, get back to it as well, and mean it.

Challenges:
If they are not open about what is stopping them to achieve the goals.
Solution: Ask them open ended questions, so they could give you more information, listen more so you could get to know about them and identify their pain points, if they don’t tell you directly.

Ground Work:
You want to identify different personalities, work styles, expectations, preferences, and career aspirations on your team, establish relationship.

In a nutshell, Make a Goal, a plan with clearly defined actions and follow up on action items.

Direct Reporte- Strength and Growth Areas(Forte)
 Their goal( Ingenii)
Growth Plan: Addressing the growth areas to achieve that goal. Talks about actions needed to address the growth area for that goal, follow up on those actions.

All of the above can only be successful if they feel respected. If they do not convey their boundaries, you need to understand that from 1 on 1s, putting them on a perceived globsmart profiles based on your interaction, listening more, asking open ended questions in 1 on 1s, asking questions to them directly.

Things to do:
+Add Goals in Chronous: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/WritingHub/Document_Repository/Goals/
+Write your strength and growth areas to be a manager and ask for feedback: 
+Make a plan to get to that goal: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CBB/CareerGrowthPlans/
+Review that plan and its progress: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/CBB/Resources/MgrToolkit/MgrCGP/

Week2: Inclusive Hiring(Self Paced)
Refer to the handout in Workdocs

Treat others as they would like to be treated
Acknowledge the similarities and differences and make a balance between the two, do not overdo it.
Measure the psychological safety of the team
Difference between Equality, Equity and Inclusion
Equality: Giving everyone the same thing regardless of what they need, starting result of someone doesn’t lead to the same outcome for everyone.
Equity: Giving everyone the resources based on their starting point for them to get to the same outcome.
Inclusion: Removing the barriers, regardless of what they do, valued for the contributions they bring, everybody part of the team regardless of what they are able to contribute.

Barriers to Inclusion:
+Language
+Team norms: shouldn’t be centred around interests of certain people, like drinks, etc. Best to rotate based on what everyone’s interests are, rather than, how to get to know each-other
+Discomfort with the unfamiliar
+Remote Location.

Interview Unconscious Bias:
Education
Age
Experience
Culture Fit
First Impression
Affinity Bias

Week3:Inclusive Leadership(Instructor Lead)

How Leadership principles align with inclusive leadership
Shared culture and shared language, understanding of behaviours, shared understanding of the direction we want to head towards.

Intersectionality(we have identity, full range of identities) not one-dimensional, acknowledging different pods of our identities intersect to make us unique.

AWS we measure Inclusion by these four things:
Valued, Connected, Trusted and Informed.(Great way to know that we as leaders are creating a culture of inclusion)

Informed:

Valued: You are trusted to do something, when peers reach out for assistance.

Trusted: Trust with important work,

Connected:
Optional get to know me quip
My managers inform the whole team on projects or any initiatives that come in and always try to pair a tenured engineer along with a new engineer who shadow sessions etc . This makes the team feel valued and trusted 

BeRightA lot is supported by Inclusion.

Common Types of Unconscious Bias:
Affinity: Folks that are like us, 
Anchoring: when we rely on one piece of information, particularly recent.
Conformation Bias: Look for ways to justify our beliefs, seek belief that would help confirm that.
Attribution Bias: Someone couldn’t do something because the other team was inexperienced, or because they are always this way, or she is always this way, so she should be this way this time too.

Q. Actions I can take to create a inclusive culture?

5 Pillars of Developing Diverse Talent:(how)


1. Value:when you ask and take actions on perspective, before any stand up session they have space for folks, tip of the month we educated one another, make sure that not only the loudest voices are listened to.
2. Relationships: How?, Avoid Unconscious Bias,Tips
3. Focus
4. Contributions: How are you comfortable being celebrated?
5. Development


Relationship:
Transparent and effective communication
Understanding the goal(short and long term) and working with them to achieve that.
Constructive feedback and Action Plan
Regular Performance Evaluation to help in Promotion
Building a culture of appreciation
Treating each person in a way they need to be treated, every individual is different.

Long term and not short term
Listening more


Understanding in My words:
Week3:Inclusive Leadership

Making people within the team feel included:

Why: 
So they want to stay in the team, so job satisfaction increase, so they co-operate in meeting team goals and making the team grow, so they care about the team, people are not robots, they have needs, which needs to be met, so they could feel safe receiving and sharing feedback so we could act on early rather than it being escalated, so they can be vulnerable and not afraid to share their mistakes, because they think about the entire team, they are accepted for who they are, not made to feel ashamed or embarrassed for sharing things about themselves, there is genuine open-ness. 

What:
+Respected: Their boundaries are respected(every individual is different).
How to know about their boundaries?
+Meet with every team member in one on ones
+Listen to them more. If they don’t talk, ask open ended questions:
What is the biggest thing on your mind today?
What are your priorities for this meeting?
+Keep a note of their boundaries and needs and remember to respect them.(Treat them the way they would like to be treated.)
Q. How would they want to be appreciated?
Q. What is their communication style?
+Consider their globesmart profile and make a note of it.

+Valued: 
Make them feel wanted, focus on their strengths, talk about their uniqueness and strengths, build their confidence.
Share to them why a decision was made, or value their unique perspectives about a decision.
Praise and acknowledge their work.
Tell them that their feedback is important and that their unique perspective is welcome.
Encourage them to share if there are any barriers to their productivity, so you could remove them.

+Trusted:
Accept them for who they are, be vulnerable, and understand every human makes mistakes(have empathy). 
Assume good intentions and don’t ask them to prove their intentions.
Trust that they are doing everything in their capacity to meet their goals regardless of their personal circumstances, ask them for any barriers they are facing so you could remove them.
Listen to their feedback, if you can’t take action on their feedback, explain to them why, 
Trust them with important work. Team members should trust each other to do important work.
 
+Informed: 
+Give them clear goals and share constructive and timely feedback. Also be transparent with them. Explain the “why’s” of very thing you inform them.
+Provide them support resources (and share ideas they could implement at their level) with them to help them navigate their career if they expressed their desire to be in a career or get to a goal of their choice. Share with them their superpowers and growth areas and guide them in ways they could tap onto their strength to innovate on behalf of the customers.
+ If they ask any question, get back to them with answers, make them connect with someone in the org if you don’t have an answer.

+Connected: 
Meet with them on one on ones, catch up with team and meet with them regularly, reply to their messages.
Following up on the goals conveyed, so they feel that the manager cares about them.
Inform the whole team on projects or any initiatives that comes in.
Take up initiatives to do something that makes everyone in the team feel connected with each-other, encourage people to use their pronouns)

How:
one on ones(meeting every team member individually), getting to know them individually(so they can convey their boundaries, needs, and expectations).
+Meet with every team member in one on ones
+Listen to them more. If they don’t talk, ask open ended questions:
What is the biggest thing on your mind today?
What are your priorities for this meeting?
+Keep a note of their boundaries and needs and remember to respect them.(Treat them the way they would like to be treated.)
+Use leadership principles to give them direction of where we want to go, and use LPs as a language to convey an information to the direct reportees.
+In a private setting, ask that employee about their preferences for making contributions, if you see someone not contributing in a meeting and being reserved
+Avoiding getting into the trap of unconscious bias.
Common Types of Unconscious Bias:
Affinity: Folks that are like us, 
Anchoring: when we rely on one piece of information, particularly recent.
Conformation Bias: Look for ways to justify our beliefs, seek belief that would help confirm that.
Attribution Bias: Someone couldn’t do something because the other team was inexperienced, or because they are always this way, or she is always this way, so she should be this way this time too.

Team Norms: 

+Decision Making:
Questions to consider: 
How are decisions made on your team? 
What mechanisms are in place to ensure diverse perspectives? 
How does your team leverage tenets to solve decision-making tensions?

+Meetings:
Questions to consider: 
What’s the structure of team meetings? 
What mechanisms are in place to collect the best inputs from all team members? 
Does the team have a mutual understanding of each individual's communication styles? 
How do you rotate leading and note-taking responsibilities? 
How do you ensure your distributed team members are heard and seen?

+ Dispersed Teams:
Questions to consider: 
How do team members in various locations communicate? 
Does the team have a mutual understanding of each individual's working styles? 
How are 1:1s conducted with your team members? 
Are some of your team members in the same location? If so, how will you make the dispersed team members feel included?

+Recognise and Praise:
Questions to consider: 
How does your team recognize each other for great work? 
What practices are in place to acknowledge and show gratitude for each other? 
Do you and others on your team know how each person prefers to be recognized?

+Team Development Time:
Questions to consider: 
What types of team development are beneficial to the team? 
How often and in what format can your team build in team development time?
For example: On my team, we implemented learning pods where each team member takes on a topic area and then shares out learnings with the rest of the group. It’s been great because it helps drive ownership for each team member to develop further expertise in a particular area, and that person then helps drive up the knowledge for the whole team.” 

Example Team Norms: https://w.amazon.com/bin/view/IHMPublic/ahmedw/TeamNorms/

Performance Management:
Great managers focus on raising the performance bar of the team on an on-going basis. They do so by identifying employees who may be already below the bar or are trending below the bar and provide timely feedback. 

They always address this using fact-based observation of their performance and describe the impact of the performance. To initiate non-judgmental discussions, they should use open-ended questions to help employees openly explain their situations first. They coach and support improving the performance, track performance or leadership behavioural issues. They ensure that if performance doesn’t improve or leadership behaviour doesn’t turn around, they make hard decisions in a timely manner. 

While most Amazonians meet or exceed the bar, there may be employees whose performance does not meet expectations after you've provided feedback. If this happens, you provide coaching and determine appropriate next steps for the employee based on their performance. 

End to End process for managing underperformers:

Question:
Joe has been on your team for six months. In the past month, he’s been late to half of the daily stand-up meetings. You know that Joe has a brand new baby at home, but haven’t heard much about it. You have your regular 1:1 with Joe this afternoon.

Ans:
You say “I’ve noticed that you’ve been late to half of the stand ups this month, resulting in your missing important updates. What’s going on?” You start with an observation and ask an open-ended question. 
This is a fact-based observation followed by description of the impact and an open-ended question. This is direct and will provide Joe an opportunity to share a root cause that can then be addressed.

Processes:
Forte:
+How to write growth ideas?
Focus on strength or superpower, tell them know this is how you can leverage your super power to realise the full potential of your abilities. You are doing good, but you have a lot of headroom for growth that can be achieved from the superpower you already have. And here is what I would do if I were in your shoes to leverage that.(Talk about the action items)
Basically, growth idea should align with the super power.

Forte Conversations:
Talk about strengths, talk about places and opportunities where(spotting and identifying opportunities) you can use that strength even more.(Make them feel valued)
What would you want to do differently? What do you want to keep doing? What is preventing you to achieve the goals that you would want to change?
What resonated with you? What made sense? What didn’t make sense?
“Keep doing what you are doing”. “Any surprises?” How do you interpret the feedback?
If it ends with pieces of ideas or action items at the end, it is successful.

Amazon Talent Evaluation:(or Promotion)
Links: https://ivy-help-center.talent.a2z.com/article/article-1568200529673-uNp1yrYjr
Guidelines:

At the time of promotion, we expect an employee will have some areas of growth at the next level. We promote those who we believe will raise the bar over time, with the potential and capability to acquire the necessary skills through coaching and on-the-job learning. If their performance is exceeding expectations at the next level, we may have waited too long to promote. 

Performing well at their current level does not necessarily demonstrate the employee’s ability to operate and deliver at the next level.

Tenure is not an indicator of whether an employee can demonstrate next-level performance. We promote when the employee’s role is scoped at the next level, and the employee has consistently demonstrated next-level performance. 

The manager should drive and own the promotion process. When the manager drives the process, the employee can focus on delivering results for their customers.

At Amazon, we consider promotions when the employee’s role is scoped at the next level and the employee has consistently demonstrated next-level performance.

My understanding:

You always have to be curious(learn and be curious), you can’t tell them what to do, no matter what they say or wanting to move out of a project or be where they are(just meeting performance expectations) and not grow, you have to be curious and ask open ended questions.

Development Conversations:
Here are some questions to seed discussion:

What are your top 2-3 focus areas for this year? How do they connect to your career aspirations and your strengths? 
What would success look like to you in each focus area? 
What specific actions will you put into place? 
How might you integrate this development into your current role?

Goal of this conversation: To identify focus areas and specific actions to put in place to work on them.

After the conversation, understand where they are in their development cycle:

And coach them based on where they are in their development cycle.

Effective Feedback(KNET)
Effective Feedback:


Social Cohesion vs seeking the truth.


Feedback: a description of specific behaviors, developmental
 exactly what they did and the impact on others
Use inclusive language

Questions to Ask to Prepare for Effective Feedback:
What did the person do that made you think they were doing a great job? What did they say and how did they say it to make you think they present well? What did they do that made you conclude their thinking wasn’t strategic enough?

Feedback is a gift

Feedback:(Constructive: need to be redirected, positive: to reinforce the feedback)

Characteristics:
+Effective and Direct: what exactly they did and impact on others
+Actionable: address specific actions rather than attitude or personal characteristics, 
+Timely: Deliver feedback as close to the time of occurrence as practical, so that it feels relevant to the recipient. Don’t limit it to monthly meetings or annual performance discussions.
+Forward-facing: Effective feedback doesn’t focus on the past—it looks towards the future. Feedback should help the recipient develop plans for future actions. Avoid vague adjectives and ensure your feedback provides clear actionable outcomes.
+Goal-oriented: Feedback drives ownership when provided in the context of the recipient’s goals. Whether positive or constructive, feedback is a mechanism managers use to help their people progress towards their goals.

Things to do:
See if you can find examples for feedback.

Goals lead to a Feedback or
 Feedback lead to Goal.
Always go back to the goal.

Four steps of Feedback Mechanism:

+Straight forward and plain language
+Amazon LP

Practices: Forte, Connections, Accolades, group emails, regular feedback in one one one conversations.

Language used to deliver feedback:
Situation, Behaviour and Impact.

Prepare for Feedback Conversations:

Fail fast and keep moving forward

Culture of Feedback:

It’s critical that you consistently provide clarity around your expectations of them and provide feedback on how they are performing against those expectations.

How would a team embrace the mindset of “feedback is a gift”?

When positive feedback is provided regularly, it makes negative feedback more credible and less threatening.
Keep a proper balance to make constructive feedback easier to absorb.
Provide more positive feedback than negative.

Q. How can you make sure 
Comfortable to accept mistakes, being vulnerable, build culture of learning from mistakes, vocally self critical, do not blame, apologise for your own behaviour if needed, listen carefully, state observations rather than generic statements.
Make a priority to listen to others, based on data, when you coach you need to have data ready with you first.

First statement important: “We need to talk” now(incorrect statement)

Brain is either reward or threat state.
When people are in reward state, they are more likely to take feedback positively. So prepare your listener first.
Threat state- they are more likely to be defensive

Ground Work:
Culture of sharing feedback in the team by:
Being vulnerable yourself, don’t mind being vocally self critical, apologise for your behaviour if required, asking in one on one’s “Do you have any feedback for me?”
Listen carefully and state the facts based on observations and data.(so they take what you say seriously).
Share positive feedback within the team and on one on ones more.
Tips on sharing positive feedback:
Don’t appreciate small work, as it would lower the bar and people wouldn’t feel motivated to raise the bar or do more as only so much is sufficient.
Look at the need of the hour, what is the behaviour that is missing that you need, if you see a bright spot, someone has done good in that regard, that is when you write a few lines so other people align their behaviour to it.

Positive Feedback:
Follow SBI model
Situation: Time, place, circumstance
Behaviour: What the person did or said, specific
Impact:How this impacts the customer, the team or others.(share your feelings, thoughts and interpretations of the behaviour.)

Constructive feedback(for the entire team):

Look at the need of the hour, what is the behaviour that is missing that you need, if you see a bright spot, someone has done good in that regard, that is when you write a few lines so other people align their behaviour to it.

First common generic message is passed to the larger group:(if it is a larger problem)
What is the issue, how do we see it and what is the ask from individuals.

Then observe and if there are any outliers, share it with individual outliers
Ask:
What is it that is missing? Do you need any support from my side?


Constructive Feedback:(for one on ones)
After gathering data(diving deep) and being prepared for the feedback conversations, don’t jump into providing the feedback straight away, ask questions so they get an opportunity to share things about themselves, chances are you don’t have to share feedback anyways and they know already, or they have a crisis in their family that they didn’t share with you before.
Ask:
“How are things going?“
Goal is to see what is their assessment of themselves and to see if anything is going on in their personal lives that is distracting them. 
If they begin to speak, ask follow up open ended questions to get to know more from them(avoid follow up questions if it is a personal circumstance), allow them to share more, don’t speak in between.

If the reportee accepts or knows about the feedback, create a SMART goal(with actionable outcomes) and again follow up on the action items, 

If reportee doesn’t accept or know the feedback, then share the constructive feedback using, for example:
“I can see you are doing great here, while we will always celebrate positive contributions, we also want to improve so you can thrive here.”.

Ask+SBI model+Ask:

Ask:(for self-assessment)
Open ended question before SBI:
“How do you think that went well?”
“Tell me how do you see this situation?”
What is he happy with? What does he think is working? What could be improved?


SBI model:
Situation: Time, place, circumstance
Behaviour: What the person did or said, specific
Impact:How this impacts the customer, the team or others.

Ask:
And after impact ask an open ended question:
“What’s going on?”
“What are you going to do next?”
“How can I help?”
“Is there something I can help you with here?”

You can also make them part of the solution to decide the action item:
What ideas do you have to solve this in the future?

After the feedback is shared,
“What are you going to do next?” or “How can I help you going forward?” 

If they don’t have any solution to provide or suggest,
You can also share alternate behaviour and alternate impact too.(that would have the action item or would contain information about the behaviour you would like to see).

Feedback Examples:

 “When you shared your 1-pager during yesterday’s team meeting with our director, you were uncertain about two of the data tables and how they were calculated. By not being clear about the data interpretation, this has affected the reputation of our team and you have lost trust with the senior leadership team.”
 
“Last week at the WBR when you responded to Anantha’s question about the new KPI, you restated her question to make sure you understood, then answered it directly with supporting details and data. You spoke clearly and concisely. You helped our team earn trust with Anatha and the other stakeholders, and I’d like you to play a larger role in the WBRs going forward.”


Feedback Conversations:(Tips)
Make sure reportee is in reward state. If they are overly self critical, get them back to their reward state, you want the conversation to be about getting to the solution, not blaming or excuses or judgements. Respect their emotions.

Goals lead to a Feedback or
 Feedback lead to Goal.
Always go back to the goal.

Some behaviours can get under our skin, but if a particular behaviour is not necessary for them to do good at their job, you can ignore that behaviour and no need to give that feedback.

If they didn’t hit their deliverables on time, say the below things:

Ask Wei about hitting his project deliverables on time. What is he happy with? What does he think is working? What could be improved?

Things to Consider:
+Sugar-Coating: Give direct feedback, no need to sugar coat.
+Backing Out: If we soften feedback, the message might be lost., for example, message was lost here: “You missed another milestone, and you never came to me so that I could help remove your roadblocks. But….the more I think about it I guess it’s been a pretty hectic month for us all”
+Offering advise too quickly(avoid immediate suggestions, encourage them to suggest their own ideas)
+Being unprepared(make sure you gather data)
+Making assumptions(state the facts and your observation, never assume anything)
+Giving only positive or only negative feedback, give both kinds of feedback
+Remember to interrupt bias and be inclusive: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hannahart/2021/05/13/giving-feedback-5-elements-of-a-more-inclusive-approach/?sh=6029b27a37fa


Coaching(KNET):
*Open ended questions, not answers, are the tools of coaching.*
Coaching involves asking questions that elicit self-reflection, exploration, and explanation. 
Coaching is helping others articulate their goals and challenges, and find their own answers.
An effective coach guides the conversation toward what is most relevant and useful for the employee. For that you would need to know their goals.
Follow a model for Coaching:

GROW Coaching Model:(combines problem solving and goal setting)
G: Goal
R: Reality
O: Options
W: Way Forward

Look at the video for reference: https://broadcast.amazon.com/videos/227208

Tip! Employees will respond differently to coaching. One person might jump to action quickly, skipping the reflection phase and risking repeating negative patterns. Another person might find it challenging to take action, even after a great conversation about goals and options. Observe how each employee responds to coaching and guide the conversation so they get the full benefit. If an employee routinely seems eager to skip a phase of the process, don’t hesitate to point it out (e.g. “I notice that you seem to want to rush through considering options”) and have a discussion about what might be causing that response.

Coaching is different from the related practices of providing feedback (i.e., describing the impacts of specific behaviors) and mentoring (i.e., providing advice or guidance from a more experienced perspective). Coaching is also different from delegation (i.e., assigning responsibility for specific tasks). Feedback, mentoring, and delegation all involve telling information, whereas coaching is about asking questions to help the employee move toward their goals.

Example: After Anuj completes a project, Nanako asks him, “What do you think went well in that project?” 
this is an effective example of coaching because Nanako used an open-ended question to help Anuj articulate his own assessment of his performance. A good coaching follow-up question might be, “What would you do differently next time?” which helps Anuj problem solve how he might raise the bar in the future.

Why:
 If you are known as a manager who will help people thrive, they will gravitate to you, your team, or your project. Second, coaching your employees will ensure that they are continuously learning, building new skills, and approaching challenges with curiosity about the new possibilities. Third, coaching your employees allows you to learn more about them, their unique strengths, interests, and preferences. Creating an inclusive environment where your team feels safe and respected is a great way to Earn Trust.

Coaching: Instructor Led(with the mentor)
Set Expectations
Measure performance
Give feedback and coaching


Start coaching from many things, like feedback, etc. You need some concrete data( to avoid bias) before beginning to coach.


Why is this important? Need to provide concrete data.What is missing and what is 


Coach them in a similar way, say the same things consistently, to them, don’t gove one info first and then second info later.


To set right expectation, understand the issue correctly.


In order to set right expectation, we need to understand the situation correctly.

==================

Connections:

https://ivy-help-center.talent.a2z.com/article/article-1611110709863-b7zXWUaLZ

Tips:

* Focussing on solutions, not opinions
* People would be in solution mode, when managers can come prepared with guided questions that aligns with their connection area that needs to be worked on.
* People start making a list of solutions, and decide who can take it up and solve it, that efforts that are put in are more sustainable and we can go back and say we solved it, solved that, which gives us motivation.
* Asking the team how do they interpret the questions.
* Create a safe environment.(can draw a lot from our interviewing techniques) Be vulnerable, express and demonstrate that leadership is willing to work on the feedback as we want to create an inclusive culture so we can support engineers working for our customers.
* Track the action items, and share the progress of the action items with the entire team. Singling someone out just doesn’t work ever.


Note:

* Deciding how and what to share (e.g. discuss sensitive topics in 1:1s)
* Reminding the team that you don’t know their individual responses
* Asking the team for ideas on how to address opportunities – don’t get hung up on question phrasing or scores
* Ending the discussion with clear actions and owners as appropriate, and following up with your team on any actions you may have taken.


Steps:

* Managers review their results in Connections Reporting
* Managers share results and discuss with their team
* Managers and their team take action
* Close the loop with the team e.g. let them know what actions have been taken.


There are several ways to share Connections results with your team, based on the topic. You may start by sending them an emailed report eachmonth from Connections Reporting. To prompt a discussion or get feedback from your team on a particular topic, we recommend 1:1s for sensitive questions or for direct feedback about manager questions. If you want to discuss questions that are categorized as “team” questions, we recommend reviewing in a team meeting. Involve individuals in identifying solutions and ask for their help in taking action as well.

Setting Goals- Discussion Guide

A key component to getting the most out of your mentor-mentee relationship is your ability to set goals. A goal is defined as an event, circumstance, or condition a person strives to attain. You will find that goal setting increases your chances for success because your goals will serve as self-motivators helping you to focus your efforts in a consistent direction.
Before your second meeting with your mentor, set aside some time to go through the goal-setting approach outlined below. Then use the second meeting to review the goals you’ve set as well as the steps you’ve laid out to achieve them, and determine the ways in which your mentor can help you achieve them.

Step 1: Creating Your Personal Vision Statement

Creating your personal vision statement is one of the most powerful and significant things you will ever do to take leadership of your life. A personal vision statement is to be used as a frame of reference to make life's decisions. They are intended to be a clear, concise expression of an individual's main purpose in life. Generally used as a starting point and motivational tool for personal growth, an effective personal vision statement requires plenty of thought and meditation.

Make a list. Included in your list should be your personal perceptions about your unique capacities and limitations. Each individual has his or her own, distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Your vision statement should address any improvements you wish to make on existing weaknesses, and the overall conditioning of your current strengths. Synthesize what you have learned about yourself to write your own statement. Remember that it is a picture of how you see yourself after you have achieved your objective, but written in the present tense.










Step 2: Establish Specific and Realistic Goals

Goals support your personal vision statement and must be specific and realistically obtainable depending on your capabilities. There are a number of ways of determining your needs. For example review your last performance valuation to identify areas for development. Read job descriptions for positions you would like to hold in the next three to five years and ascertain what skills you would need to qualify for these positions. Note that it is the role of your mentor to tactfully encourage you to set goals that represent a challenge for you but that will not lead to the frustration of failure.

As you are developing your goals, remember:

S - specific, significant, stretching

M - measurable, meaningful, motivational

A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented

R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented

T - time-based, timely, tangible, trackable









Step 3: Set Deadlines

Setting specific time limits for goals encourages action and commitment. Deadlines can be set for different periods of time, such as daily, short-term, and long-term, and a realistically set deadline allows you to measure your performance.







Step 4: Develop Your Action Plan

Your action plan describes, step by step, how you are planning to reach your goals by the deadlines you have set.





Step 5: Determine How Your Mentor Can Help

These steps will be reviewed with your mentor so that together you can determine how to best utilize the relationship, whether that means connecting you to key individuals or just checking in to make sure you’re making progress towards your goals while providing insights along the way. Still, you should bring a set of expectations and assumptions to the meeting and make those clear. Some of these may include:

* Expecting the mentor to introduce you to key individuals
* Expecting the mentor to help you get a promotion, find a new job, etc.
* Expecting the mentor to teach you x, y, z skills

Questions for mentor:
Q. How would I identify my growth areas? I need to identify one personal career development goal I would like to accomplish by the end of the program with Mentor's help. The goal should align with my growth areas outlined in the manager readiness document and add and track goal progress in Ingenii.
Q. What are the things(skills) I need to be good at as a manager? I understand writing, time management, communication, earning trust
Q. What should I do to get to my goal. Any ideas?
Q. Did you see my manager readiness document? Can you identify any growth areas for me?
Q. Is it possible for us to review ops manager levelling guidelines?

FLDP Mentor-Mentee Sessions

02nd Aug 2023:
Going through Manager Readiness Document and talking about what managers need to do.

 We always think of mechanism or process to prevent similar issues in the future.
We need to make people work in a particular direction, engage people, make the direction clear.
We work together, provide reasons as to why we believe that is the thing we create, and tell engineers why the decison was made.
Set expectations and Provide feedback, not everyone is perfect, Create goals, set expectations and provide feedback
Why: If there is gap and if we don’t set right expectations and provide continuous feedback based on expectations, engineers would get frustrated by the outcome at the end(because they didn’t expect that, they might think they are doing great and they may not be if we didn’t set expectations clearly.)
Respect Diverse view, everything has pros and cons, that way they would be encouraged to speak, otherwise they just shut their mouth and they don’t share much, we need to hear feedback and opinion from others.
Enabling others to focus on team goals and priority., think about the entire team, thinking of the entire team can impact some people, sometimes that same thing is good for some people and bad for some others. Think of team goals and priorities, and sometimes managers need to make hard decisions.

For example, in OLR: Assess engineer’s performance, need to make hard decisions, bad performers for a long time, people managers make decisions for entire team, so people be motivated to work hard.

Need to make decisions from team’s perspective.

You need to provide data for a decision.
If you make a decision, measure its impact.
How to measure the impact of the decison?
Think Pros and Cons of a decision. What will happen if we make a change? What will happen if we let things be? Do we have any alternatives?
 
If it is a two way door-decisions, practise bias for action and don’t waste time diving deep, 

Think Pros and Cons, and alternatives provide them guideline and plan to make more people attend. Think about other stakeholders.

Action Items:
Think about "Use mechanisms to drive outcome for the customer"

Home-Work:
Use mechanisms to drive outcome for the customer.
Cross-Account Support problem:

Problem/Impact:
Security is at risk if information about resources in one account is sent to customers of another account. 

Solution:
+Training engineers to verify the account no associated with the case against the account no associated with the resource.
+Encouraging engineers to share instances where they handled cross account support scenarios correctly and call them out in standup/meeting.
+Add a CC tooling mechanism where engineers can’t reply to a case if the resources shared in the case by the customer belong to a different account.

How:
+Regular KNET Mandatory Security Tip trainings

16th Aug:
 Discussion on the previous action item:
Thought Areas while deciding the mechanism:
Identify why the problem happened- process or engineer mistakes
Identify big picture and not one example
Not solely relying on engineer, but making a process instead, because we have New Hires, teams keep changing, etc
While deciding the mechanism, consider the cost, make a cost benefit 
Focus is to prevent that kind of an issue again.
Building up a process or tool is the best.

This aligns with our LPs Invent and Simplify.

Things to think about for Capstone Project:

Impact of this problem, expectations, relevant teams, team’s efficiency and operations

What will happen if the situation keeps going the way it is?

Is the problem big enough for us to focus on?

Action Items:
Ask Dax if it is okay for the mentor to share manager readiness document?
Think about the problem statement for Capstone Project.
Think about “Navigate through changes to ensure peer buy-in and engagement”

Home Work:
Navigate through changes to ensure peer buy-in and engagement:

It means that me, as a manager is suggesting a change in direction because there is some problem following through the current direction, but would need to make sure all other involved teams are on board with me on that.

I would first discuss the impact of the problem, not just on my team but on their team and work as well. I will explain to them what will happen if we don’t do anything and leave the way things are, so they come on board with me on why it is important to do something about the problem.
Then I would explain how my suggestion would help address the pitfalls of the current way of doing things. I would use data and metrics to support my suggestion, so people come on board.
Would try to put my suggestion as easy to follow action items as much as I can, so the teams are likely to jump into it sooner, if they think it may not require much effort to start seeing the results.
I would listen to different perspectives from different teams and make changes or modifications in my suggestions, if required. They would also feel they are heard and likely be heard in the future when the suggestion is actually carried out practically.

Leadership Principle: Dive Deep would lead to Earning Trust. 


30th Aug:
Discussion on the previous action item:
Great answers, covered everything on “Discuss Navigate through changes to ensure peer buy-in and engagement”
Mentee won’t be able to attend session on 13th Sep and that would be rescheduled.

Dive Deep is important, but sometimes bias for action is needed for a two-way door decision.
Bias for Action is two-way door situation, different situation to make a decision, even though you don’t have enough data, but if it is pressing, you can make a decision.

Mentor shared Manager Readiness document with the mentee.
Mentor shared two example initiative documents with the mentee.

Action Items:
Think about “Set expectations and provide ongoing feedback”
Go through example initiative documents and start writing for your Capstone Project on "Building a mechanism to ensure we deliver quality training to all our engineers."
Go through the Coaching PPT shared by Dax to ask questions to the mentor.
